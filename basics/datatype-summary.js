// Q. Is Javascript is dynamically typed or statically typed language?
// Answer. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. 
// This means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, not at compile time.
// In other words, you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable when you create it;
// it can change during the execution of the program.
